### PQS Concept

![Landscape](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36871448-4809-4bc2-b775-ae3b0d83c3b1)

Property Qualification Score (PQS) can be adapted to evaluate a new town or a developing section of a town. When assessing a larger area like a new town, the PQS would include similar criteria, but it may require aggregating scores from multiple zones within the area to get a holistic view. For instance, you would evaluate the accessibility of the main roads and transit options that would service the town, as well as the availability and quality of infrastructure such as water, power, and internet across different sections. Additionally, since zoning and land use plans might still be in the developmental stages, the scoring would take into account both current and proposed zoning laws, potential changes, and how these align with the town’s projected growth and purpose.

Environmental and physical factors remain essential for a new town or section of town, especially when considering topography, natural hazards, and any environmental restrictions that could affect development. Since market value data may be limited in emerging areas, prospective property valuations would be based on comparable developments in similar nearby areas. Future infrastructure projects play a key role in the PQS for such areas, as they directly impact long-term viability. In new towns, planned amenities, parks, and other public facilities contribute significantly to the overall quality, enhancing the scores in the neighborhood and community categories. The adaptability of PQS for different areas makes it useful for determining a new town’s potential before extensive development begins.

The PQS is also suitable for evaluating existing city districts or city areas, especially when assessing these regions for potential redevelopment or improvement. Using PQS, each district can be evaluated based on its current infrastructure, accessibility, and amenities, providing a snapshot of its strengths and areas needing investment. Scoring for accessibility, neighborhood quality, and infrastructure would reflect the district’s existing assets, such as proximity to schools, transit hubs, and commercial centers. Zoning and land use evaluations would consider whether the district’s current zoning aligns with modern needs and potential for more mixed-use development.

Environmental factors in city districts might be less about natural hazards and more about pollution levels, green spaces, and noise levels, which impact livability scores. Market value and tax data are typically more readily available in city districts, allowing for a more precise analysis of these factors. With a focus on development potential, the PQS could highlight how well-suited a district is for new residential, commercial, or recreational spaces, based on future city projects or planned infrastructure enhancements. This comprehensive PQS analysis can help city planners and investors make data-driven decisions about redevelopment and resource allocation in a way that aligns with long-term urban goals.

#
### PQS System

Creating a Property Qualification Score (PQS) system for city management supports strategic planning, zoning, infrastructure investments, and overall community development. This system would enable city officials to assess properties and districts quantitatively, integrating individual property-level PQS evaluations into a broader city-wide framework. By establishing a set of criteria tailored to reflect city-specific priorities, officials can use the PQS system to make data-driven decisions about where to invest resources, which areas to rezone, and how to manage growth sustainably. Criteria in this system can be customized based on the city’s unique characteristics and long-term goals.

Key categories for PQS in city management might include accessibility, infrastructure quality, zoning and land use, environmental factors, market value, and development potential. For example, scoring each city district’s accessibility and transportation options provides insights into how well-connected various areas are to major roads, transit hubs, and essential amenities. Infrastructure assessments would address the availability and quality of utilities, road conditions, and public facilities, all of which contribute to the livability and operational functionality of the city. Additionally, evaluating zoning and land use regulations helps city officials align development plans with modern needs, such as encouraging mixed-use areas or supporting higher-density housing in areas primed for growth.

To ensure the PQS system reflects city priorities, each criterion should be scored on a scale (such as 1 to 10) and weighted according to its importance. If improving public transit is a city goal, for example, then accessibility criteria could be weighted higher. In this way, the PQS system supports holistic city management, enabling officials to visualize each area’s strengths and weaknesses and compare districts systematically. By regularly updating PQS scores with new data on market values, environmental resilience, and infrastructure quality, city officials can dynamically adjust plans and investments in response to changing needs, maximizing the long-term sustainability and prosperity of urban areas.

In his YouTube video, The Backyard Scientist experiments with creating metal sculptures by melting steel BBs. Inspired by natural fulgurites, he aims to form shapes resembling frozen lightning. After some trial and error, he uses a welder with argon gas and adds silicon bronze wire to strengthen the creations. Despite some failures, he ultimately succeeds, showcasing unique, organic-looking sculptures that are solidified with epoxy for added durability and glow-in-the-dark effects. He concludes the video with tips on replicating his method.

Alignment:

A method for aligning the steel BBs with precision is could be used for achieving clean, well-defined forms before welding them together. The process begins with arranging the BBs into the desired shape, often within a container or mold that helps hold them in place. Ensuring a uniform layout across the area helps in evenly distributing the welding heat, which creates a more cohesive structure. As the balls are delicately placed, the arrangement is carefully monitored to prevent any shifting or gaps, as this could impact the final outcome once welded.

Once the BBs are positioned in the desired configuration, welding them together in a single pass ensures that they fuse simultaneously, creating a seamless bond. This method prevents uneven cooling or inconsistent welding patterns that could weaken the structure. Precision welding, especially in larger or more complex forms, requires a steady hand and often involves using a foot pedal to control the heat output finely. By welding all the BBs together at once, the finished piece holds a consistent texture and a visually compelling, cohesive form, resembling an organic shape like a frozen lightning strike.

### Permanent State Materials

The exploration of permanent state materials in construction offers a pioneering shift towards creating enduring structures that require minimal maintenance and have significantly longer lifespans. Materials such as geopolymer concrete and engineered stone are at the forefront of this movement. Geopolymer concrete, for instance, is not only more environmentally friendly due to its lower carbon footprint compared to traditional Portland cement, but it also possesses superior resistance to heat and chemical attacks. This allows structures to maintain their integrity and aesthetic appeal over time. Additionally, engineered stone, known for its high durability and low porosity, is ideal for both interior and exterior applications, providing a permanent finish that can withstand the elements while remaining visually stunning.

Furthermore, the use of permanent state materials enhances sustainability in the construction industry by reducing waste and resource consumption. By investing in materials that can effectively resist degradation and do not require frequent replacement, builders can minimize the environmental impact associated with traditional construction practices. Innovations such as synthetic slate and glass fiber reinforced concrete also play a critical role, offering longevity and aesthetic versatility without the drawbacks of natural materials. These materials not only support the creation of robust, lasting structures but also align with the growing demand for sustainable building practices. Emphasizing the adoption of permanent state materials can lead to a new era of construction where durability, efficiency, and environmental stewardship go hand in hand.
