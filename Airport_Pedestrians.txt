Watching airplanes take off and land can be a unique and engaging attraction for local residents, offering a mix of entertainment, awe, and curiosity. Many cities have designated viewing areas or observation decks near their airports, providing safe and accessible spots for aviation enthusiasts, families, and casual spectators to enjoy the spectacle of aircraft in motion. This activity fosters a connection between the community and the airport, showcasing the engineering marvels of flight and the hustle of global travel. Cities can enhance this experience by creating park-like spaces near runways with amenities like seating, informational plaques about aviation, and food trucks, turning a simple activity into a memorable outing. These viewing areas can also become small tourism draws, adding charm and character to the city's recreational options.

Airport architects generally do not design airports to intentionally avoid or thwart away local pedestrians, but the location and layout of airports often result in them being inaccessible by foot. Airports are typically situated far from urban centers to accommodate their large size, reduce noise pollution, and meet zoning requirements. The focus of airport design is primarily on facilitating air travel and accommodating vehicles, including cars, buses, and trains, rather than encouraging pedestrian access. The lack of sidewalks, proximity to highways, and expansive, traffic-heavy road networks surrounding most airports make walking there impractical or unsafe. These design choices are rooted in prioritizing efficiency for large volumes of passengers arriving by vehicle rather than catering to local foot traffic.

If airports were easier to access on foot, more people might casually visit for non-travel-related purposes, such as shopping, dining, or exploring cultural exhibits. Airports often feature amenities like restaurants, retail stores, and art displays, which could appeal to local residents if reaching them were more convenient. Pedestrian-friendly designs, including safe walking paths and seamless connections to nearby neighborhoods, could transform airports into community hubs rather than exclusively travel-oriented spaces. This shift could enhance airports' roles as social and economic centers, attracting a broader demographic and fostering local engagement with airport facilities.
