üè∫ Research and evaluation of necessity for the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt.

Ancient Necessity

The ancient Egyptians invested lifetimes into the future of mankind and the adundance of environmental space when they designed and constructed thier very large, strong and complex stone structures. The desertified location for the Great Pyramid of Giza was chosen because of the empty sand covered landscape that is mostly unused by people, animals and plants. 

Today, in comparison to modern engineering feats, Egyptian structures are outdated and almost unnecessary. These structures are reinvested into the futures of mankind every day, year and century that passes without destruction.

Modern Construction

Larger environmental modifications and construction projects have been competed after the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. The total volume of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is estimated to be around 2.5 million cubic meters (or 90 million cubic feet). When comparing it to more modern construction projects, its volume may seem modest.

The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the tallest building in the world, boasts a total volume of approximately 2.6 million cubic meters, nearly matching that of the Great Pyramid. Similarly, the Three Gorges Dam in China, the largest hydroelectric dam in the world, has a staggering volume of around 39.3 billion cubic meters, dwarfing both the Great Pyramid and the Burj Khalifa. These examples showcase the incredible diversity and scale of construction projects throughout history, from ancient wonders to modern engineering feats.

| Construction Project      | Location        | Total Volume (cubic meters)  |
|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Great Pyramid of Giza     | Egypt           | 2.6 million                  |
| Burj Khalifa              | Dubai, UAE      | 2.6 million                  |
| Three Gorges Dam          | China           | 39.3 billion                 |

The Burj Khalifa is a modern skyscraper made primarily of steel and glass, which are more susceptible to corrosion and deterioration over time. Additionally, Dubai's climate, while not as harsh as some other environments, still presents challenges for long-term preservation.

If the Burj Khalifa were abandoned without maintenance, it would likely suffer from deterioration over time. However, its fate would also depend on factors such as the structural integrity of its materials and any measures taken to protect it from the elements. With proper care, it could potentially stand for centuries, but it would likely require ongoing maintenance to ensure its longevity.
