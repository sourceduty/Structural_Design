Property Qualification Score (PQS) Equation Cheat Sheet

Equation Format:
PQS = Î£ (Si * Wi)

- Si = Score for each criterion (1 to 10 scale)
- Wi = Weight assigned to each criterion (importance)
- n = Total number of criteria

Final PQS Calculation:
PQS = (S_Accessibility * 0.20) + (S_Neighborhood * 0.15) + (S_Infrastructure * 0.10)
     + (S_Zoning_Laws * 0.15) + (S_Permits_Required * 0.05) + (S_Potential_Zoning_Changes * 0.05)
     + (S_Topography * 0.05) + (S_Natural_Hazards * 0.05) + (S_Environmental_Restrictions * 0.05)
     + (S_Property_Valuation * 0.10) + (S_Comparable_Sales * 0.05) + (S_Taxes_and_Fees * 0.05)
     + (S_Development_Potential * 0.05) + (S_Future_Infrastructure * 0.05)
     + (S_Utilities * 0.05) + (S_Resource_Requirements * 0.05)
